The transform given by the first equation is called the inverse Fourier transform ($\\nu \\to t$) and that given by the second is called the Fourier transform ($t \\to \\nu$). Because no information is lost if sampling at or above twice the largest frequency component *these relationships carry no approximations* with respect to the periodic functions $f\\!\\left[t\\right]$ or $F\\!\\left[\\nu\\right]$. Due to the efficient [fast Fourier transform](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FastFourierTransform.html) (FFT) algorithms, DFTs are the preferred method of performing Fourier transforms numerically.\n",
        "\n",
        "An interesting side effect of the sampling theorem is that the representation of the frequency domain becomes periodic. The time range $\\pm 1/(2 \\ d\\nu)$ is the periodic time window that corresponds to sampling the frequency domain in steps of $d\\nu$. Similarly, the frequency range $\\pm 1/ (2 \\ dt)$ is now the periodic frequency window due to sampling the time domain in steps of $dt$. The frequency $\\nu = 1/ (2 \\ dt)$ is called the [Nyquist frequency](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NyquistFrequency.html), and is the maximum allowed frequency for a given time domain step size. Any components that are at frequencies greater than the Nyquist frequency will [alias](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Aliasing.html), or wrap, back onto the primary grid.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is helpful to interpret the above equations as discrete integrals that correspond to summations over **grids that are centered on $t_m$ ($\\nu_n$) and extend in bins of $\\pm 0.5 \\ dt$ ($\\pm 0.5 \\ d\\nu$)**. Thus, the integrals span the entire $\\Delta t = N \\ dt = 1 / d\\nu$ and $\\Delta \\nu = N \\ d\\nu = 1/dt$ periodic windows. This is readily seen for grids that contain an odd number of points but requires some more careful consideration when the number of points is even. The minimum coordinate index in that case is $-N/2$, which is exactly at Nyquist, and the maximum index is at $N/2 - 1$, which is one step size below Nyquist. To complete the window, one must only realize that the negative half step from $-N/2$ aliases up to meet the positive half step from $N/2 -1$. This means that for an even number of points the information at the positive Nyquist frequency is aliased down to the negative. While there is enough information to fully represent the sampled points, as predicted by the sampling theorem there is in general not enough to reconstruct the sampled function in its entirety. Thus, a discrete Fourier transform sampled with *an even number of points* is only strictly valid if there is *no amplitude in the Nyquist component*. One special exeption is the discrete Fourier transform of a purely real function. For this case, do to the symmetry inherent in the Fourier transform of a real function the positive and negative Nyquist terms are real and equal, so a DFT sampled at the Nyquist frequency will return two times the amplitude of the actual Nyquist components. The full real-valued function can then be reconstructed by taking half of the amplitude of the negative Nyquist component and placing it in a frequency bin at the positive Nyquist component."

        "The analytic formulation is useful for the efficient representation of real physical quantities, and interfaces nicely with the complex fft and ifft functions. However, there are times when the real representation is necessary or more efficient, such as when the input array is real or when dealing with nonlinear operations that are difficult to perform directly in analytic form. Many numerical packages include a more efficient implementation of the fft that only calculates and returns the positive half of the spectrum, specifically for transforming real input in the time domain. With the help of array indexing operations, these rfft and irfft operations allows simple translation from analytic to real valued representations:\n",

In general, the frequency domain output array has $N = \\lfloor N_r/2 \\rfloor + 1$ number of points, where $N_r$ is the total number of points in the time domain. This does not pose any complications when using the rfft, but the integer division and the standard normalization procedure means that *the number of real output points must be explicitly given to the irfft function*. The number of points in the frequency domain has other implications, the *frequency domain output array is always arranged such that the coordinates are in monotonic order*. The time domain array should still be ordered as described in the previous section, but since the rfft only returns the positive side of the spectrum it stops before needing to wrap around, with the slight caveat that the Nyquist frequency (when reached) is considered positive instead of negative.\n",

This is due to the frequency bin at the origin extending into both positive and negative frequencies. In order to preserve the integrated power, the power in that bin must not change. In the second condition, when the number of points in the real representation is even the bin contains information aliased from both the positive and negative Nyquist frequencies. The power is preserved only if one Nyquist component is considered, if only half of the combined amplitude is retained. In addition to the amplitude renormalization, the first and last point of the rfft array must obey the complex symmetry relationships about the origin. The amplitude at the origin must be real, and if the number of points in the real representation is even then the amplitude at the Nyquist frequency must also be real.\n",

        "Do to the added complexity of keeping track of these details, it is easier to just not include the origin or the real representation's Nyquist frequency in the analytic array, i.e. the origin and the Nyquist frequency of the real-valued representation should effectively have zero amplitude. This is easily accomplished by starting the frequency grid of the analytic representation away from the origin and using an odd number of points if the sampling is Nyquist limited. Then, the transformation from one representation to the other needs only use the uniform scaling of $\\sqrt{2}$ for all points."
