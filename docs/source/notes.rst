Notes
=====
These notes provide an introduction to the mathematics and optical physics used by PyNLO. They cover the basics of Fourier transforms and the quirks of their numerical implementation as FFTs; linear optics, as pertains to the propagation of light in optical modes; and nonlinear optics, including how nonlinearity is theoretically and numerically implemented within a generalized propagation equation.
